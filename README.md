**ABANDONED! Please check out my newer project [Quark](https://github.com/Wykerd/quark) which replaces this one** 

# FireAnt

A small, embeddable and secure JavaScript/TypeScript runtime using QuickJS and Unicorn Velociraptor. Inspired by and based of txiki.js.

# Why?

FireAnt is designed to be easily embedded into other programs to provide user scripting.

FireAnt aims to use less dependencies than txiki.js using only libuv for the non-blocking C.
